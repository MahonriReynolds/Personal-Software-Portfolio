# Overview

This program was written as a proof of concept for a locally hosted inventory management dashboard. While the inventory itself is kept in Airtable, this web application provides a simplified workflow for specific use cases such as reporting new inventory, reporting usages, and identifying basic trends. While still an extremely rough draft, this system provides a good idea of what the application will try to accomplish.

The primary learning goal of this project was to explore the basics of JavaScript. This initial draft contains five JS programs. Collectively, these programs look at displaying output, using native array functions, basic recursion, using external libraries, throwing errors, and interacting with the DOM.

# Future Work

- The entire application needs a rehaul. Several features need to be added and the code needs to be refactored and optimized.
- If I haven't made it clear enough yet, this is not a polished product and has only barely been stitched together as a proof of concept.
